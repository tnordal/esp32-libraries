# ESP32 Libraries Collection

## ESP-IDF Sensors Library

A library for interacting with AHT20 (temperature/humidity) and BMP280 (temperature/pressure) sensors using ESP-IDF. Features include easy I2C initialization, automatic sensor detection, and a simplified API for reading temperature, humidity, and pressure data.

Key features:

- Easy I2C initialization and device scanning
- Support for AHT20 temperature/humidity and BMP280 temperature/pressure sensors
- Global sensor state handling for simplified API
- FreeRTOS task examples for periodic sensor readings
